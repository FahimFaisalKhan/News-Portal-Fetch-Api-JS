            Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate
            function body. Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted.
            Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing
            scope even before they are declared. Variables declared with the let
            keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope
            to the immediate enclosing block.

            Inside an object if we call this method within an arrow function it
            will give us its corresponding dom element as output where as
            regular/nprmal function will give current object as output . Normal
            functions can be called before declaration but arrow functions can
            not be called before declaration as they are not hoisted.

            Map forEach,filter,find all of these 4 are array methods . map
            executes some function on an array by a for loop and returns another
            another nodified array. forEach does the same thing as map but the
            difference is it does not return anything , it justs executes the
            code in the function without any return value. Filter is also an
            array method which goes through the array with a function by for
            loop , filter returns all values that satisfies specified
            condition/conditions. Find does the same thing as filter but it only
            returns the first value that meets specified condition/conditions.

          Q4. Why use template literals'?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content font-semibold">
          <p class="text-2xl">Ans: Template literals:</p>
          <p class="bg-yellow-200 text-slate-700 rounded-lg p-4 mt-2 text-xl">
            The reason is simple .. Template literals provide an easy way to
            interpolate variables and expressions into strings. The method is
            called string interpolation.
